## üìú About
This project contains the backend from the QuizSphere application (frontend mobile code: https://github.com/Gust4voSales/QuizSphere-Cliente).
The app was developed with the objective of gaining experience and knowledge using updated technologies. QuizSphere is a mix of a quiz game and social networking features.

What the app does/allows:
 - Play quizzes;
 - You can create quiz games that can be either public or private (only the author from the quiz or whomever
has received the private quiz can play it);
 - Search for quizzes;
 - Evaluate quizzes with likes;
 - Add/remove a quiz from your favorites' list
 - Add friends;
 - Share quiz with your friends;
 - Receive real-time notifications in the app whenever a user accepts your friends invitations or when someone shares a quiz with you;
